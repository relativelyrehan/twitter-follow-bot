# twitter-follow-bot
this bot will follow back all those people who follows you
Using Tweepy module this bot will follow back all those people who
are following you on the twitter.

I haven't figured out a way on how to make it run continuosly,
when all those people who are following are followed back
the bot will throw tweeperror as all the people are already
being followed or requested to follow.

working on to eliminate this error.
